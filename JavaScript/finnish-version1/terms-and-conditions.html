			</ul>
			<h3>Summary of a Consumer’s key legal rights</h3>
			<ul class="list-group">
			<li class="list-group-item">This is a summary of a Consumer’s key legal rights. These are subject to certain exceptions. For detailed information please visit the Citizens Advice website www.adviceguide.org.uk or call 03454 04 05 06.</li>
			<li class="list-group-item">The Consumer Rights Act 2015 says Goods must be as described, fit for purpose and of satisfactory quality. During the expected life of the Goods, a Consumer’s legal rights entitle the Consumer to the following:</li>
			<li class="list-group-item">			
				<ul class="list-group">
					<li class="list-group-item">- up to 30 days: if the Goods are faulty, then you can get a refund.</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">- up to six months: if the faulty Goods can't be repaired or replaced, then you are entitled to a full refund, in most cases.</li>
					<li class="list-group-item">- up to six years: if the Goods can be expected to last up to six years, you may be entitled to a repair or replacement, or, if that doesn't work, some of your money back.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">5.8 If you wish to exercise your legal rights to reject the Goods you must return them in via post them to us or (if they are not suitable for posting) allow us to collect them. We will pay the costs of postage.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">5.9 This Condition 5 shall apply to any repaired or replacement Goods supplied by us.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>6. Health and Safety At Work</h2>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">6.1 We, acting in good faith, provide product information about the conditions necessary to ensure that Goods supplied will be safe and without risks to health when properly used. You should not consider this of itself to constitute an adequate risk assessment, as may be required, under health and safety legislation.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">6.2 If you are or become aware of any risk to health or safety about the Goods, you must immediately contact us.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>7. Delivery</h2>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">7.1 We will advise you of any delivery costs during the Order process.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">7.2 We shall ensure that each delivery of the Goods is accompanied by a delivery note. If the Order is being delivered by instalments, the delivery note will indicate the outstanding balance of Goods remaining to be delivered.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">7.3 We shall deliver the Goods to the location set out in the Order or such other location as you and we may agree (Delivery Location) at any time after we notify you that the Goods are ready.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">7.4 Delivery of the Goods shall be completed on the Goods' arrival at the Delivery Location.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">7.5 Any dates quoted for delivery are approximate only, and the time of delivery is not of the essence. We will deliver the Goods to you as soon as possible and in any event within 30 days of our acceptance of the Order.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">7.6 If no one is available at the Delivery Location to take delivery, we will leave you a note informing you of how to rearrange delivery or collect the Goods from a local depot.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">7.7 If you do not collect the Goods from us as arranged or if, after a failed delivery to you, you do not re-arrange delivery or collect them from a delivery depot we will contact you for further instructions and may charge for storage costs and any further delivery costs. If, despite our reasonable efforts, we are unable to contact you or re-arrange delivery or collection we may end the Contract and Condition 15.4 will apply.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">7.8 If we miss the delivery deadline for any Goods then you may treat the Contract as at an end straight away if any of the following apply:</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">
					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class="list-group-item">A) We have refused to deliver the Goods.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">B) Delivery within the delivery deadline was essential (considering all the relevant circumstances).</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">C) You informed us before we accepted the Order that delivery within the delivery deadline was essential.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">7.9 If you do not wish to treat the Contract as at an end straight away, or do not have the right to do so under Condition 7.8, you can give us a new deadline for delivery, which must be reasonable, and you can treat the Contract as at an end if we do not meet the new deadline.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">7.10 If you choose to treat the Contract as at an end for late delivery under Condition 7.8 or Condition 7.9, you can cancel the Order for any of the Goods or reject Goods that have been delivered. If you wish, you can reject or cancel the Order for some of those Goods (not all of them), unless splitting them up would significantly reduce their value. After that we will refund any sums you have paid to us for the cancelled Goods and their delivery. If the Goods have been delivered to you, you will have to return them to us or allow us to collect them, at our cost.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">7.11 We may deliver the Goods by instalments, which shall be invoiced and paid for separately. Each instalment shall constitute a separate Contract. Any delay in delivery or defect in an instalment shall not entitle you to cancel any other instalment.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>8. TITLE AND RISK</h2>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">8.1 The risk in the Goods shall pass to you on completion of delivery.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">8.2 You cannot resell the any Goods purchased from Finnish Coatings.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>9. PRICE</h2>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">9.1 The price of the Goods shall be the price set out in the Order. We take reasonable care to ensure that the price of Goods is correct. If there is a pricing error, Condition 9.3 shall apply.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">9.2 We may, by giving notice to you at any time before delivery, increase the price of the Goods to reflect any increase in the cost of the Goods that is due to:</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">
					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class="list-group-item">A) Any factor beyond our control (including foreign exchange fluctuations, increases in taxes and duties, and increases in labor, materials and other manufacturing costs).</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">B) Any request by you to change the delivery date(s), quantities or types of Goods ordered.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">c) Any delay caused by any of your instructions or your failure to give us adequate or accurate information or instructions.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">9.3 It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some Goods may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check prices before accepting the Order so that, where the Goods’ correct price at the date of the Order date is less than the stated price, we will charge the lower amount. If the Goods’ correct price at the date of the Order date is higher than the price stated in our price list, we will contact you for its instructions before we accept the Order. If we accept and process the Order where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and could reasonably have been recognized by you as a mispricing, we may end the Contract, refund you any sum you have paid and require you to return the Goods at our expense.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">9.4 The price of the Goods is inclusive of amounts in respect of value added tax (VAT). If the rate of VAT changes between the date of the Order and the date we supply the Goods, we will adjust the rate of VAT, unless you have already paid for the Goods (including delivery costs) in full before the change in the rate of VAT takes effect.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">9.5 We may invoice you for the Goods on or at any time after the date of the Order.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">9.6 If you consider an invoice is incorrect, you should contact us promptly, and we will not charge you interest until we have resolved the issue.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>10. PAYMENT</h2>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">10.1 Goods shall be paid for prior to delivery of the Goods.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">10.2 You shall pay all amounts due under the Contract in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>11. DATA PROTECTION</h2>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">11.1 We will use the personal information you provide us to:</li>

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">11.2 We will only give your personal information to other third parties where the law either requires or allows us to do so. For example, we may share your personal information with organizations such as our legal advisers and collection agencies to recover sums due from you.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>12. Returns</h2>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">12.1 We, subject to Condition 13.2, will not accept the return of Goods, if the Order was:</li>

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">12.2 Condition 12.1 shall not apply if the Goods do not comply with Condition 5.1.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">12.3 If we do allow you to return Goods, we may require you to provide evidence of purchase (for example, a delivery note or invoice) and to pay a restocking charge (being a minimum 20% of the returned Goods’ value) before accepting a return.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>13. Special Orders</h2>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">13.1 We may make additional charges if the Order is for goods not stocked (or created for the customers specifications) by us and we must specially obtain them (a Special Order).</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">13.2 You cannot change or cancel a Special Order once we have accepted it.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>14. Consumer Rights to End The Contract</h2>
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item">14.1 You may contact us to end the Contract at any time before we have delivered the Goods (but not if a Special Order) and you paid for them, but in some circumstances, we may charge you for doing this, as described below. You always have rights where a product is faulty or not as described (see Condition 5).</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">14.2 If you are ending the Contract for a reason set out in this Condition 14.2 the Contract will end immediately and we will refund you in full for any Goods which have not been provided or have not been provided properly and you may also be entitled to further compensation. The reasons are:</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">
					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class="list-group-item">A) We have told you about an upcoming change to the Goods or these Conditions which you do not agree to (see Condition 17.5).</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">B) We have told you about an error in the price or description of the Goods and you do not wish to proceed.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">C) There is a risk that supply of the Goods may be significantly delayed because of an event outside our reasonable control (an Unforeseen Event).</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">D) We have suspended supply of the Goods for technical reasons, or we notify you that we are going to suspend them for technical reasons, in each case for a period of more than 2 months.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">E) You have a legal right to end the Contract because of something we have done wrong (but see Condition 7.10 relating to your rights to end the Contract if we deliver late).</li>
					</ul>				
				</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">14.3 If you are not ending the Contract for one of the reasons set out in Condition 14.2, the Contract will not end until 30 days after the day on which you contact us. We will refund any advance payment you have made for Goods which will not be provided to you. For example, if you tell us you want to end the Contract on 4 February we will continue to supply the Goods until 3 March. We will only charge you for supplying the Goods up to 3 March and will refund any sums they have paid in advance for the supply of the Goods after 3 March.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">14.4 If you end the Contract after we have dispatched the Goods to you and (because we cannot recall them) they are delivered to you, you must return them to us. If you are ending the Contract because we have told you of an upcoming change to the Goods or these Conditions, an error in pricing or description, a delay in delivery due to an Unforeseen Event or because you are exercising your legal rights to end the Contract because of something we have done wrong then we will pay the costs of return. In all other circumstances, you must pay the costs of return.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>15. Ending The Contract By Us</h2>

				<li class="list-group-item">15.1 If you become subject to any of the events listed in Condition 15.2, we may end the Contract with immediately by giving written notice to you.</li>

						<li class="list-group-item">A) We shall under no circumstances whatever be liable to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, for any loss of profit, loss of income or revenue, loss of anticipated savings, or wasted time.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">B) We shall be responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of us breaking the Contract or us failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the Contract was made, both you and we knew it might happen, for example, if you discussed it with us during the sales process.</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">C) Our total liability in respect of all other losses arising under or about the Contract, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, shall in no circumstances exceed the value of the Goods supplied under the Contract.</li>

				<li class="list-group-item">16.3 Without affecting our liability under Condition 16.2, we recommend that you check the Goods for defects or discrepancies as soon as possible. If you find a defect or discrepancy in the Goods, or suffer loss or damage that is a foreseeable result of us breaking the Contract or us failing to use reasonable care and skill, please let us know as soon as you become aware of the relevant issue. You should then take reasonable steps to minimize the damage or loss you may suffer.</li>

				<li class="list-group-item">17.3 If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Conditions, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of you breaking the Contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you later.</li>

				<li class="list-group-item">17.5 Except as set out in these Conditions, no variation of the Contract, including the introduction of any additional terms and conditions, shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by us.
