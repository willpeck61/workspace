#Roles Definition

**Project Lead – Will**

*Description*: This is the person with authority to manage the whole project and lead the team to a specified direction. Oversees the project with clear communication with the managers (Lead Tester, Lead Developers, Project planner) to achieve one project goal by working collaboratively.

*Responsibility:* The Project Lead should assign members to each role depending on each individual’s skill, keep the vision on track and communicate with every team member to maintain motivation. Manage, reviews, and prioritise the project work plans with objective to stay on time. Effectively manage project resources to ensure the project runs efficiently with the appropriate use of members. Also, approve job orders and change orders to adapt changes that are caused by external influences. Ensure coordinator is distributing the correct information to the whole team and all manager level members know what they are expected to achieve with a specified deadline. Leading the team during meetings to ensure all relevant points are addressed in order to maintain reasonable progression of developing the solution. Ensuring all the essential (MUST) requirements elicited from the client are fulfilled and advise other team members on any missing features.

**Coordinator – Phoebe**

*Description:* Distributing information throughout the team, ensuring the communication channels are correctly in place to achieve the optimal efficiency for transportation of information.

*Responsibility:* The project Coordinator should arrange meetings and take minutes to document suggestions in the meeting. Distribute the minutes on the same day as the meeting so other members in the team can proceed with development and review what happened during the meeting. Consequently, if one member missed a meeting for any reason, the coordinator should make sure the unattended member knows about the minutes and the time for the next scheduled meeting. Making sure that meetings are being held periodically and ensuring all members attend the meeting.

**Project Planner – Ross**

*Description:* This person should organise and construct models to illustrate the total length and effort for the project.

*Responsibility:* Create a Gantt chart and keep it updated appropriately throughout the project. Resources should be clearly stated on the chart to represent work distribution so the optimal efficiency can be achieved. Task dependency also needs to be implemented carefully so a critical path is available. This will reduce the risk of increasing the overall project length that may potentially increase the amount of budget. Consider when meetings should take place for the best results i.e. meetings held too often could slow down development process and on the other hand; misunderstanding could occur if communication are not taking place frequently enough.

**GUI Designer – Gavin**

*Description:* The designer should communicate with the Project Lead to design and construct prototype UI designs.

*Responsibility:* Construct a user interface design with consideration of the users’ usability. Also, undertake thorough research on potential designs that can be implemented into the software. Consult the client to address the client’s expectation and possibly find out the target audience in order to adjust the design accordingly. Ensure the UI has a consistent layout and each type of user (searcher, administrator, landlords) can be distinguish with the different style of interface.

**Lead Developer (front-end) – Will**

*Description:* This person will lead the front-end developers to accomplish tasks within the deadline. Manage the programming of the front-end of the system. Communicate with back-end Lead Developer on the construction of the program.

*Responsibility:* Communicate with Project Lead to confirm the exact solution is meeting the expectation for the users (searchers, administrators and landlords). Delegate tasks to Developers (front-end); ensure that they are working towards the same goal and jobs are not duplicated. Offer support and advice if other developers encounter any difficulty on programming. Ensure tasks are completed on time so the project would not be delayed.

**Lead Developer (back-end) – Ihtasham**

*Description:* This person will lead the back-end developers to accomplish tasks within the deadline. Manage the programming of the back-end of the system. Communicate with front-end Lead Developer on the construction of the program.

*Responsibility:* Communicate with Project Lead to confirm all the functions that are expected from the client to be included within the solution. Delegate tasks to Developers (back-end); ensure that they are working towards the same goal and jobs are not duplicated. Offer support and advice if other developers encounter any difficulty on programming. Ensure tasks are completed on time so the project would not be delayed.

**Developer (front-end) – Ross, Phoebe, Gavin**

*Description:* This role should have the ability to translate algorithms and technical specifications into code that can be executed on a computer system.

*Responsibility:* Complete parts of the programming according to the Lead Developers’ assignment. Communicate with GUI Designer to ensure the coding matches to the prototype design. Construct programming code that is readable for other developers due to the collaborative coding structure. Add comments whenever appropriate because it will increase the readability of the code which will reduce the time consumed by other developers trying to understand the code.

**Developer (back-end) – Kalin, Connor, Ihtasham**

*Description:* This role should have the ability to translate algorithms and technical specifications into code that can be executed on a computer system.

*Responsibility:* Complete parts of the programming according to the Lead Developers’ assignment. Make sure all the functional features will perform exactly as how the client expected it to by working against the requirement specification. Construct programming code that is readable for other developers due to the collaborative coding structure. Add comments whenever appropriate because it will increase the readability of the code which will reduce the time consumed by other developers trying to understand the code.

**Lead Tester - Ihtasham**

*Description:* This person has the authority to lead the other tester in the team, allocate tasks in order to complete all the required testing. Also, mentor the testers when necessary.

*Responsibility:* Review scenarios constructed by the testers, make sure they are accurate and not redundant. Communicate with Project Lead to ensure that all features of the solution are included in the cucumber automated tests. Allocate coding tasks to testers so all testing members are developing at the same time with no duplication, this will ensure the testing to be completed on time as modelled on the Gantt Chart.

**Tester - Kalin, Connor**

*Description:* Complete all testing components using BDD approach to maintain the quality of the solution.

*Responsibility:* Develop all required Gherkin scenarios also write universal tests to carry out appropriate testing. Communicate closely with Lead Tester to ensure all the required coding is completed.
