**1. What are the expected features included within the first release?**

**2. What are the requirements for different interfaces for user types?**

  Landlords/student/young professional/administrator
  
  Features/functions/options
  
  Map/GPS
  
  Web/mobile?
  
  It is stated that the system should provide only 2 different interfaces. Does this mean standard users and landlords share the same   interface?

  Because then that would suggest users are meant to select between being a student or a landlord on creation of the account as I       assume one interface is for users and the other is intended for Administrators.

**3. Could we show a textual list of the properties alongside the generated map?**

[In case the user can't find the specific property on the map itself, it'll also be listed underneath.]

Could there be an option to not display the map? (I.e. if a user has low bandwidth. This could be toggled on the search form)

**4. How would you describe buddy-up feature? Is it suggesting a share of an accommodation where the two users will be able to view/book properties together? How many buddies can there be in a pair?**

Will there be an option to turn buddy-up on/off AFTER account creation?

What about the ability to search for potential buddies?

**5. What should be included in the 'Express interest' notification?**

Searcher's username and the interesting property?

**6. In what way should analytic data be presented? Should it be hidden from public?**

Essentially; how much are user's allowed to know about other users?

**7. What does a 'report' consist of?**

 [These can be sent to an administrator.] 
 
 Should there be options to tailor the contents of a report, or is it simply "searcher/property was reported"?

**8. How should we justify long-term and short-term?**

**9. In regards to the following extract of the case study:**

  "The software system should use information provided by users:"
	  
	  o "On the amount of time taken between to get between houses and university/workplaces
	  
	  o "Give feedback/ratings on both accommodation and amenities."
  
  Should there be an option to set univeristy/work on a user's profiles? Would this be viewable to others?
  
  Similarly, should we make feedback/ratings on accomodation viewable on the property page?

**10. In what format should the 'Express Interest' alert to the landlord be presented as?**

For example, should they recieve an email notification? Or should it be something along the lines of a message that the landlord can reply with?

**11. In terms of profiles, does a landlord also have a profile?**

**12. In what way would a landlord respond to an 'Express Interest' alert?**

**13. Does the user messaging service have to be real-time? Or is it adequate to use email-like messaging?**

**Further clarification on location services/GPS**

How many interfaces does the app require in terms of using location?

Is it essential to implement real-time navigation for instance? 

Is it essential to have GPS tracking? What if GPS is unavailable?

Would it not be very inefficient for users to use a web application for navigation rather than a mobile application?
