# Configuration Management Plan
# CO2015-Group 3

## Source Control

We will have a branch for Sprint 1 that each member of the group uploads their files to, this ensures that each feature implemented can be thoroughly tested and checked to ensure that it works before merging it with the master branch. We will then use pull requests to merge the Sprint 1 branch into the master branch once we have ensured a feature is working correctly.

## Code Reviews

We will have multiple meetings over the course of the development cycle to review the code that has been developed and pushed to the Sprint 1 branch. We will push code that we feel meets our coding standards and passes tests to ensure it is functioning correctly. 

## Coding Checkstyle

We will follow an existing coding standard that is provided by Google to make sure that code formatting and structure is compliant with the standard, but more specifically to ensure that all the code in our project follows one consistent structure which is very important.
