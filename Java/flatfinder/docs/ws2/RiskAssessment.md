# Risk assessment
-----------------------

**1 -**  **Risk Identification**

**1.1 -**  **Definition**

### What is a risk management plan?

A risk management plan is a document that is produced after the risk assessment has been completed; the risk assessment assesses potential risks that may occur during the execution of a project. The risk management document outlines the foreseeable risks, estimated impact and provides actions to be taken both to prevent and to reduce the impact of any identified risk.

A risk is "an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project's objectives."

**1.2 -**  **Categories**

Simply list the categories

- Resources & Team
- Legal
- Communication
- Security
- Integration
- Change management
- Requirements

**1.3 -**  **Risks**

Below are the top ten risks that could occur during the duration of the project. Each risk has been given a category and an Id number, which will be referred to within this document.

| Category          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                | Id          |

**2 -**  **Risk Quantification**

The next step is to quantify the likelihood and the impact of each risk. It's important to workout the likelihood and the impact of each risk as it will give a better understanding to which risks are great than others. To workout the priority score, both the Likelihood table (2.1) and the Impact table (2.2) will  be used.

**2.1 -**  **Likelihood**

Below is the 'Likelihood' table. This is used to simplify the information into a basic one or two word title whilst still giving a complete description of each title. Each row is given a Title, Score out of 100 and a Description.

| **Title** | **Score** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Very Low | 20 | Highly unlikely to occur; however, still needs to be monitored as certain circumstances could result in this risk becoming more likely to occur during the project  |
| Low | 40 | Unlikely to occur, based on current information, as the circumstances likely to trigger the risk are also unlikely to occur... |
| Medium | 60 | Likely to occur as it is clear that the risk will probably eventuate  |
| High | 80 | Very likely to occur, based on the circumstances of the project  |
| Very High | 100 | Highly likely to occur as the circumstances which will cause this risk to eventuate are also very likely to be created  |

**2.2 -**  **Impact**

Below is the 'Impact' table. This is used to simplify the information into a basic one or two word title, whilst still giving a complete description of each title. Each row is given a Title, Score out of 100 and a Description.

| **Title** | **Score** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Very Low | 20 | Insignificant impact on the project. It is not possible to measure the impact on the project as it is minimal  |
| Low | 40 | Minor impact on the project, e.g. < 5% deviation in scope, scheduled end-date or project budget  |
| Medium | 60 | Measurable impact on the project, e.g. 5-10% deviation in scope, scheduled end-date or project budget  |
| High | 80 | Significant impact on the project, e.g. 10-25% deviation in scope, scheduled end-date or project budget |
| Very High | 100 | Major impact on the project, e.g. >25%% deviation in scope, scheduled end-date or project budget  |



**2.3 -**  **Priority**

Below is the 'Priority' table. The priority table establishes the priority of each risk by identifying the likelihood of the risk and its impact on the project. The 'Priority Score' can be calculated as follows:

Priority equals the average Likelihood and Impact score, or simply

_Priority_ = (_Likelihood_ + _Impact_) / 2

| **Id** | **Likelihood** | **Impact** | **Priority Score** | **Rating** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1 | 20 | 40 | 30 | _Low_ |
| 1.2 | 30 | 60 | 45 | _Medium_ |
| 1.3 | 20 | 40 | 30 | _Low_ |
| 1.4 | 50 | 50 | 50 | _Medium_ |
| 1.5 | 60 | 90 | 75 | _High_ |
| 2.1 | 40 | 100 | 80 | _Very High_ |
| 3.1 | 40 | 70 | 55 | _Medium_ |
| 3.2 | 50 | 40 | 45 | _Medium_ |
| 3.3 | 60 | 30 | 45 | _Medium_ |
| 4.1 | 60 | 90 | 75 | _High_ |
| 4.2 | 20 | 70 | 45 | _Medium_ |
| 5.1 | 60 | 50 | 55 | _Medium_ |
| 6.1 | 70 | 80 | 75 | _High_ |
| 7.1 | 40 | 60 | 50 | _Medium_ |

The '_Rating_' is based on the calculated priority score. Use the following system to determine the '_Rating_'

| Priority Score | Priority Rating |
|----------------|-----------------|
| 0 - 20         | Very low        |
| 21 - 40        | Low             |
| 41 - 60        | Medium          |
| 61 - 80        | High            |
| 81 - 100       | Very high       |


**3 -**  **Risk Plan**

Once all the risks have been identified and assessed, a plan has to be drawn up that will set out how to minimize the chances of the risks arising during the project, along with a recommended course of action should any of the listed risks occur.

**3.1 -**  **Schedule**

The schedule lists all the risks in order of priority. Each risk has the steps

taken to prevent the 'likelihood' and a contingence plan to reduce the 'impact' of the risk.

- The preventative actions to be taken to reduce the likelihood of the risk's occurring
- The contingent actions to be taken to reduce the impact should the risk occur.

For each risk action identified, assign a resource responsible for undertaking the action and a date within which the action must be completed. For example:





| Rating    | Id  | Preventative Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Action Resource                      | Action Date | Contingent Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Very high | 2.1 | **Litigation due to loss of personal data through hacking or other security breach during the normal execution of the product.** <br><br> All aspects of code that impact security must be tested in accordance with a prescribed procedure designed to minimize security breach.Encrypt all user data using public key cryptography. In order to test the code's security level, the developers and testers should employ 'Brute Force' and 'SQL injection' techniques. This will give a good assessment of the level of security offered by the system.All testing should be documented, dated, signed off by the project leader and filed. | Developer / Tester                   | dd/mm/yy    | Initially a meeting with the client should be called in an attempt to come to a mutually acceptable resolution to the situation.If no mutually acceptable solution can be found then professional legal council should be sought.The project planner and leader should ensure that all documentation is available in support of any legal action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| High      | 4.1 | **Technology components have security vulnerabilities.** <br><br> The code should be tested at least once a week or at each revision that effects potential security issues. In order to identify vulnerabilities, the developers and testers should attempt to 'break' the system at regular intervals. Breaking the system allows the developers to identify and rectify issues highlighted by the testers, thereby increasing the security of the system.                                                                                                                                                                                   | Developer / Tester                   | dd/mm/yy    | The code should be programmed in such a way that it is completely maintainable. If such vulnerability should arise, it will be easy to 'patch' the problem quickly, allowing a clean fix to be implemented in a reasonable timeframe. If the application has been made public, and has regular users, then the project leader and lead developer should be involved in this process as users personal data could be at risk.                                                                                                                                                           |
| High      | 6.1 | **Failure to integrate with agreed systems.** <br><br> Once a week, the code must be tested on the agreed systems. The application will not necessarily be the same all agreed systems, as a result the project testers should thoroughly test all functionality on each agreed system thus reducing the likelihood of any integration problems later on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Developers / Testers                  | dd/mm/yy    | Check that the configuration and version of the system is as agreed within the original specification. If the system is not inline with the originally agreed specification then a new project to update the code to meet the new needs could be considered. If the system is within the specification of the original brief then a remedial plan needs to be implemented to identify the cause of the issue and a solution needs to be implemented.                                                                                                                                   |
| High       | 1.5 | **Not enough time left for thorough testing** <br><br> Plan a relatively large chunk of time at the end of the project to perform testing during. Failure to do this could result in not enough time for testing resulting in a high amount of bugs in the application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Project Planner | dd/mm/yy    | Partially do some of the testing throughout the project so that at the end a large portion of the application has already been tested so in the worst case scenario where we don't have enough time for testing we will have at least done a large chunk of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Medium    | 3.1 | **Potential loss of communication between developers and clients or between team members.** <br><br> For every milestone achieved by each member of the team, a message should be sent to either the project leader, the project coordinator or the whole team, informing him or her of the progress that has been made. The individual must also upload segments of the code and associated documentation to a central shared repositoryRegular progress meetings must be held with the clients to ensure progress is as expected and the direction is still valid.                                                                           | Project Leader & Project Coordinator | dd/mm/yy    | In the event of a perceived loss in communication between team and client, the project leader must immediately arrange an update meeting with the client to bring matters up to date and assure the customer that no further breakdown will occur.A breakdown in inter team communication must be dealt with by the project leader by reaffirming the importance of communication and highlight the potential liabilities associated from such a breakdown. The project leader should then monitor directly the communication for a period of one week.                               |
| Medium       | 3.2 | **Object design doesn't match with implemented code** <br><br> When distributing the features to members of the team we should also assign those members to create the object design for their particular feature before they start working on it.

**4 -**  **Risk Process**

The risk process helps identify the risks associated with projects. The methods employed are easy to follow and to understand. This section describes the purpose and the process when identifying the risks associated with a project.

**4.1 -**  **Purpose**

The Risk Process shows the steps needed to implement Risk Management. Using the risk process ensures that the project objectives will be met.

The risk process can be broken down into several sections:

1. Risk Analysis
    * When to use Risk Analysis
    * How to use Risk Analysis
2. Estimate Risk
3. Manage Risk
    * Avoid the Risk
    * Share the Risk
3. Accept the Risk
4. Controlling Risks

_Risk Analysis_ is the process that helps identify the potential risks that could effect the successful completion of the project. After you have identified the potential risks, the 'likelihood' of that risk from happening needs to be quantified. In general this is represented as a percentage, 0% representing "Will never happen" and 100% representing "Will happen". After the likelihood has been quantified, the 'impact' it will have on the project needs to be determined, and as with likelihood, represented as a percentage.

When should Risk Analysis be employed? Risk Analysis can be used to support the planning any kind of event, from planning a project to improving health and safety.  Risk Analysis is useful in many situations.

To carry out a successful Risk Analysis, the potential threats to successful completion need to be identified. Once identified procedures can be put in place to minimize both the occurrence of the threat and the impact should it occur.  Threats can arise from many different sources, including:

 Natural: weather, disease, disasters...

 Project: going over budget, immature technology, human error...

Overcoming threats is often challenging, but fortunately there are well-established tools and procedures designed to help. SWOT Analysis is considered to be the most helpful tool when overcoming threats.

"A useful link would be - [https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC\_05.htm](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_05.htm)"

Estimating the risk is relatively straightforward. Firstly establish the 'likelihood' and the 'impact' of the risk. Once established, each must be given a priority or Priority Score, that is calculated by taking the average of Likelihood and Impact score, or simply  _Priority_ = (_Likelihood_ + _Impact_) / 2.

Managing a risk can be a challenging task due to the number of options/variables involved. Once the priority of the risk has been established, ways to manage it can be determined, for example, a risk can be avoided, shared or accepted.

 Avoiding the risk is generally the best solution. However is important to note that avoiding a risk does not mean ignoring the problem. Risk avoidance can include designing the execution of the project in such as way as to minimize or even eliminate the risk.

Sharing risk is common practice with projects. If a risk is becoming more and more likely to occur; opting to share the risk with another team or company can sometimes circumvent the issue, thus reducing or even eliminating the risk.

The last option is to accept the risk, sometimes it is best to accept the risk and try to address the problem as efficiently as possible. Sometimes more time is spent trying to avoid the risk than is required to address the issue itself.

A good example: "Accept that the risk of the project launching late if the potential sales still cover your costs." - [http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accepting-risk.asp](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accepting-risk.asp)

Controlling the risk is the most effective way of understanding the risks. Controlling risks does not necessarily mean continuous monitoring, but refers to the 'likelihood' and the 'impact' of the risk. From this actions can be put in place to reduce the likelihood and the impact should the risk arise. These are known as Preventative and Contingent actions.


**4.2 -**  **Procedures**

Below is a diagram representing the process taken to identify and mitigate the risks with the project.
