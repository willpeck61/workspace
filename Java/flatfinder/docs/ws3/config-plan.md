# Configuration Management Plan
# CO2015-Group 3

## Source Control

We will have a branch for Sprint 2 that each member of the group uploads their files to, this ensures that each feature implemented can be thoroughly tested and checked to ensure that it works before merging it with the master branch. We will then use pull requests to merge the Sprint 2 branch into the master branch once we have ensured a feature is working correctly.

## Code Reviews

We will have multiple meetings over the course of the development cycle to review the code that has been developed and pushed to the Sprint 2 branch. We will push code that we feel meets our coding standards and passes tests to ensure it is functioning correctly. Over the Easter Holidays this will be more difficult to do so we will be doing this over Skype rather than physically meeting up.

## Coding Checkstyle

We will follow an existing coding standard that is provided by Google to make sure that code formatting and structure is compliant with the standard, but more specifically to ensure that all the code in our project follows one consistent structure which is very important.

## Communication with Project Planner

Members of the group will communicate their progress in regards to their
sections of the group work to the Project Planner on a regular basis to ensure
the project plan stays up to date at all times. This will be achieved using
multiple different methods, one of these methods is opening/closing issues on
the GitHub repository that shows what tasks need to be done and have been done. Another method of communication with the Project Planner is other instant
messaging services such as Facebook and WhatsApp.

## Weekly Progress Checks / Meetings

Before the Easter Holiday commences there will be multiple meetings each week that checks the progress of each member of the group and discusses any details that need to be addressed. Once the Easter Holidays begin we will start using Skype as a method of communication every week, in these meetings we will be discussing the progress of group members and addressing any concerns.
