## Group 3

### Sprint 2 Retrospective

#### Start
- Be strict with completing tasks on time.
- Make sure intital features are completed before assigning new ones.
- Keeping better progress of what we've individually compelted. This makes updating the Gantt easier, and helps facilitate meeting discussions. (Often group members would struggle to think what they'd been working on as either there were too many things to recall, or they were fairly minor.)
- Find an alternative method of communication. We used Facebook and Whatsapp, but had issues with both. I.e. people weren't checking regularly or weren't getting message updates.
- Find a meeting schedule that works for everyone. The only meetings attended by everyone were the first and last as people had working commitments over Easter.
- More research before starting tasks [Gavin].
- Using custom search classes for searching through the database with the repository. [This essentially uses multiple FindBys in different for loops; if one loop returns no results, the next is used etc. Ultimately it's more efficient]

#### Stop
- Programming before writing tests. Scenarios should be written first, then tests, then code, then step definitions.
- Using Skype. Each meeting had connection issues for various people. We considered using Google Hangouts instead.
- Leaving work until the last minute. Causes stress and the work is generally of a lower quality.

#### Continue
- Good communication and frequent meetings; meetings were regular and had a (generally) good turn out. People made effort to be there.
- Good organisation. Tasks were allocated quickly and fairly and everyone was happy with their workload.
- Using GitHub issues. They were very useful for keeping track of what needed to be done, and breaking tasks down into chunks.
- Using everything we've learned. We believe using the knowledge we now have we could reach the end standard much more quickly and build the product up from there. (Towards the end of the Sprint we realised some methods we used weren't the most efficient, but we didn't have enough time to overhaul everything. If we were to have Sprint 3 we'd used these new methods. An example is custom search classes, mentioned above.)

#### Sprint 2 General Reflection

#### Good

##### Will:
- Everyone worked really well together.
- No one had any major issues; everyone handled minor problems easily and quickly.
- Everyone respected one another; people weren't critical.

##### Ross:
- Productivity at start was strong; we had a lot of meetings to plan tasks and make sure everything would be done on time. In the past we'd had to rush to complete a lot of work at the end, whereas for Sprint 2 we consistently worked on the project.

##### Connor:
- Much better understanding of writing step definitons
- Implemented very high quality CSS animations

##### Kalin:
- Documentation of meetings was clear and helped people keep track of progress when they couldn't attend.

##### Gavin:
- Communication was improved; attended many meetings and asked questions.
- Split work fairly with no arguments.

##### Phoebe:
- Implemented site-wide CSS changes and gave the site it's overall look and feel
- Became very handy at Bootstrap
- Ensured there was good attendence at meetings over Easter when the group members were in different locations.

##### Ihtasham:
- Many features were easier to implement than thought. No major programming issues.

#### Bad

##### Will:
- Nothing

##### Ross:
- Had issues with Skype so couldn't take part in meetings

##### Connor:
- Broke some CSS rules that needed fixing.

##### Kalin:
- Nothing

##### Gavin:
- Nothing

##### Phoebe:
- Had some phases of not completing enough work and falling behind on schedule.

##### Ihtasham:
- Nothing.
