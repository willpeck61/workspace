DMA requires entire process to be loaded into memory before can be executed.
Swapping places processes onto swap space in backing store, then loads the next required process
back into memory.

Virtual memory
Each process has a logical address space which is divided into pages.
Pages are then loaded to physical memory addresses (page frame) in no particular order when in use.
When a request is made for a page not in physical memory (page frame) produces a page fault.
An existing page frame is then emptied and the required page is loaded in.
This is achieved through different page replacement algorithms.
